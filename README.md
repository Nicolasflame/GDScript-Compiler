## Overview

GDScript-Compiler is a powerful tool that compiles GDScript into machine code. This allows developers to optimize their GDScript code for better performance. By converting scripts to machine code, you can reduce execution time and improve your game's overall efficiency. 

## Features

- **Fast Compilation**: Transforms GDScript into machine code quickly.
- **Optimized Performance**: Runs compiled code faster than interpreted scripts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands make it easy to use.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to contribute to the project or modify it as needed.

## Installation

To install GDScript-Compiler, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Nicolasflame/GDScript-Compiler/releases). 
2. **Extract the downloaded file** to your desired location.
3. **Run the executable** file to start using the compiler.

Make sure to check the [Releases section](https://github.com/Nicolasflame/GDScript-Compiler/releases) for updates and new features.

## Usage

To compile a GDScript file, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./GDScriptCompiler path/to/your_script.gd
```

This command will generate a machine code file that you can use in your project. 

### Options

You can customize the compilation process with various options:

- `--output`: Specify the output file name.
- `--optimize`: Enable optimization during compilation.
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logs during the compilation process.

Example:

```bash
./GDScriptCompiler --output my_script.bin --optimize path/to/your_script.gd
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to help you get started:

### Basic Compilation

To compile a simple GDScript file:

```bash
./GDScriptCompiler my_script.gd
```

### Compiling with Output Name

To specify an output name for your compiled file:

```bash
./GDScriptCompiler --output compiled_script.bin my_script.gd
```

### Enabling Optimization

To enable optimization during compilation:

```bash
./GDScriptCompiler --optimize my_script.gd
```
